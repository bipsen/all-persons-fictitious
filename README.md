Use Pute Data (https://puredata.info/) to run the .pd file. The chatbot and synth communicate via Open Sound Control (OSC). To use OSC in pd, you need to download the mrpeach library (Do this via "Help" > "Find externals" and search for "mrpeach"). To activate sound in pd, remember to turn on DSP ("Media" > "DSP On").
